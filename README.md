# Library Carpentry: Introduction to Git with Graphical Interfaces

This workshop is an adaptation by Dr. Nathaniel D. Porter (Virginia Tech University Libraries) of the Library Carpentry: Introduction to Git lesson that provides an introduction to the concepts, value, and workflow of version control with Git without requiring any command line (BASH/UNIX) programming. Many librarians may need to work with collaborators using Git-based respositories and versioning systems without learning to program. 

We recommend combining this with the Introduction to Data (Regular Expressions), Open Refine, and Tidy Data lessons for a full (2-day or 4 half-day) Library Carpentry workshop that doesn't require using the command line. 

Full information on the original workshop is below. Material in the original and adapted workshops is made available under the [Creative Commons Attribution

This lesson is still in alpha (early development). Please create an issue or pull request or reach out via email (ndporter@vt.edu) with questions.
